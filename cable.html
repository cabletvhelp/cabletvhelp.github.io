      <p>
        Spectrum cable TV is the cheapest provider in this U.S., but it is surprisingly expensive. According to a Consumerwatch.org analysis in March, 2019, the rates can go sky high and it may even be more “pricy.” In fact, it may not even be on this list.

          <a href="https://www.verizon.com/home/fiostv/">FiOS</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          FIOS may seem expensive, but the picture quality is much, much better than that of other cable providers.
