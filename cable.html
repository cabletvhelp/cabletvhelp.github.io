        Spectrum cable TV is the cheapest provider in this U.S., but it is surprisingly expensive. According to a Consumerwatch.org analysis in March, 2019, the rates can go sky high and it may even be more “pricy.” In fact, it may not even be on this list.

          FIOS may seem expensive, but the picture quality is much, much better than that of other cable providers.
